# IT-254-Group-Project-
Group Project for IT 254. Our project is we are creating a home security system that has face detection and can contain alarms.
# This project was made with these other collaborators
# Hardware used
We used a 3d printed door model that we got from Tinkercad https://www.tinkercad.com/things/jrjchUGjqYP/edit?returnTo=%2Fdashboard%2Fdesigns%2F3d.
We also used the Arduino kits to connect to the door and make it open.
Our project is pretty much entirely based off this door model.
# Instructions
These are what we used to make our program function
# Getting the door to work
Connecting the Ardunio kit to the door to get it to open was a challenge, but we were able to get a demo of the door that my groupmate made. 
Once we got the demo door to work, we worked on our face recognition code and then 3d printed the new door. 
We connected the code, door, and Arduino kit to finish the project.
