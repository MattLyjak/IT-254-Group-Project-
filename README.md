# IT-254-Group-Project-
Our project is we are creating a simple home security system that has face detection and will open a door if the person detected is accpeted and is apart of that home. If the person detected is not apart of that home, then the door will not open for them.

# Hardware used
We used a 3d printed door model that we got from Tinkercad https://www.tinkercad.com/things/jrjchUGjqYP/edit?returnTo=%2Fdashboard%2Fdesigns%2F3d.
We also used the Ardunio Mega 2560 keypad with a motor connected to the door to open and close it. We also use our computer cameras to do the face detection.
Our project is pretty much entirely based off this door model.

# Instructions
Required hardware to make this work:
-VSCode
-Python
-Ardunio 
-Ardunio mega 2560 keypad
-small 3d printed door 
-Teachable machine 
-web cam 

# Getting the door to work
Connecting the Ardunio kit motor to the door to get it to open was a challenge, but we were able to get a demo of the door that my groupmate made. 
Once we got the demo door to work, we worked on our face recognition code and then 3d printed the new door. 
We connected the code, door, and Arduino kit to finish the project. The final project consisted of our house that had the 3d printed door connected to it and all of the hardware inside the door. We then connect the Arduino kit to our laptop via USB and the code on our computer along with the web cam operates the door.
